A small collection of VBA Subs I've written 

1. Rebalance
    small sub that filters a tabel by a named cell on a different worksheet
    copies a column of the filtered table to the "main" worksheet 
    calculates if the exsisting column of the "main" worksheet are equal and if not places the delta in a third column
